## How to Delevop feature in Time tracker
First of all to develop any feature you will need a complete idea of how nop plugins function.

### 🔧 Trello Powerup Client Plugin
- To develop any feature in Trello powerUp client plugin you will need to know about 
[Trello powerup client library](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/power-ups/ )
- the whole plugin depends on ajax request handled by time tracker plugin. so to post/get any data you will have to create api endpoints in time tracker plugin along with entities/models/factories/service etc.

### 🔧 Time Tracker Plugin
- Its actually very easy to add any API  endpoints here. Just copy an existing API endpoint and modify it as per requirement.
- Any entity or domain you need must be created on this plugin.

### 🔧 Weekly Report Plugin
- this plugin has two parts one in the public site and another in the admin area. So any feature you need to develop should be based of area either public or admin area.
- In the admin area, adding a feature is quite simple as goes by the book.
- But in the public site there are two main features "Date Range Report" and "Daily Standup Report". To add anything in these views you will need to work on their js files. They JS files may seem complex and hard to understand as the dont belong to default nop views. So take time and try to understand how things work.

Hope this doc has helped you understand how Nop Time Tracker works and how to develop features in this system.
